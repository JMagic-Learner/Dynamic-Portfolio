## Description
Hello, my name is Jason Ma. This application is called Dynamic-Portfolio (React).
              
Description:
This application converts my serverside Professional Portfolio into a REACT based portfolio. This has the majority of the same functionality as my serverside application.              
          
Coding Process
The process is to break down and convert the modularity of the server based portfolio into React based components. Whereas the serverside application uses HANDLEBARS to dynamically render data via ROUTES, this REACT is purely client-side. In a way, there is a lateral translation between HANDLEBARS and Component rendering.
